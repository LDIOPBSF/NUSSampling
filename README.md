**********************************************************************************
 NUSSampling : Norm-based Utility Subsequence Sampling.                         
 It's a generalisation of the CSSampling algorithm of Diop & al. (ICDM2018).    
 NUSSampling takes into account several utilities that base on the norm of      
 the patterns. This version is under consideration for publication in Knowledge 
 and Information Systems (KAIS2019).
